## The problem

SQLite is a wonderful thing. It is one file, one library, no server. You
link it, you open a path, and you have a real SQL database. Then the disk
that holds the file dies, and you have nothing.

So you want copies. Three machines, one database, and every copy exactly
the same, even while machines crash and restart and the network misbehaves.
The moment you say "exactly the same", you have a consensus problem. This
project solves it with [paxos-zig](https://github.com/insanai/paxos-zig),
a Multi-Paxos library, and it stays embeddable: link one Zig library (or
the C ABI), open one data directory, and you get a durable SQL store as a
single node or as a transport-owning cluster. The companion CLI is `zaxon`.

## Two ideas worth understanding

Everything else in this repository follows from two decisions.

**Replicate the bytes, not the SQL.** Most replicated SQL systems send the
SQL text to every node and execute it everywhere. That is a trap. Run
`insert ... values (random())` on three machines and you get three different
databases, each one convinced it is right. Zaxonlite executes each
transaction once, on the leader. SQLite's own write-ahead log tells us
exactly which pages that transaction committed, and those page images are
what Paxos replicates. Nondeterministic SQL is safe by construction, because
nothing is ever executed twice. Replicas converge to byte-identical files,
and the tests verify that with digests across cluster members.

**The journal is the truth; the database file is a cache.** Every protocol
write is framed, checksummed, appended, and fsynced before the consensus
layer is allowed to proceed. A write is acknowledged only after its slot
commits and carries the client's own batch. The SQLite file is just
materialized state: delete `current.db` and the node rebuilds it from the
last snapshot plus the journal suffix. If you remember one thing about
operating zaxonlite, remember this one.

## What you get

- One writer, one to nine voters, and any number of non-voting nodes:
  `standby` (promotion-eligible copy), `read-replica` (read copy),
  `witness` (votes, holds no SQL), and `gateway` (a stateless router).
- Exactly-once sessions. Session state rides inside the replicated
  transaction, so retries replay recorded results across restarts and
  leader failover.
- Three read levels: `any` (local, possibly stale, labeled, with a
  freshness bound), `leader`, and `linearizable` (a quorum read fence with
  no log append and no disk sync per read).
- Snapshots and epoch rollover: online checkpoints seal 2,048-slot epochs,
  every member builds a byte-identical generation, and rollover is
  crash-resumable.
- Mutual TLS 1.3 on every production TCP listener, with short-lived
  single-use certificate enrollment (`zaxon enroll`).
- A C ABI: `libzaxonlite.a` plus `include/zaxonlite.h`.
- A crash matrix that kills real processes at chosen write-path points and
  proves recovery, plus fuzzing, soak, and network-fault suites.

## Quick start

One durable local node, authorized by owner-only socket permissions:

```sh
zaxon serve --data ./d1 --node 1 --listen unix:./zaxon.sock
zaxon sql   --data ./d1        # interactive shell, embedded mode
```

A three-voter cluster (repeat symmetrically on nodes 2 and 3):

```sh
zaxon serve --data ./n1 --node 1 --listen 127.0.0.1:9901 \
    --peer 2@127.0.0.1:9902/data-voter \
    --peer 3@127.0.0.1:9903/data-voter \
    --tls-cert n1.crt --tls-key n1.key --tls-ca ca.crt
```

Then talk to it. The client follows leader redirects:

```sh
zaxon wait   --connect 127.0.0.1:9901 --leader
zaxon exec   --connect 127.0.0.1:9901,127.0.0.1:9902 --sql "insert ..."
zaxon query  --connect ... --sql "select count(*) from t" --level linearizable
zaxon status --connect 127.0.0.1:9902 --json
zaxon backup --data ./d1 --to ./backup.db
```

Every client TCP command supplies its identity with `--tls-cert`,
`--tls-key`, and `--tls-ca`. For a one-machine experiment, `--dev-psk`
permits PSK-only TCP on loopback addresses only.

`zaxon sql` on a terminal is a rich REPL: readline-style editing, arrow-key
history with `ctrl+r` search, SQL highlighting, aligned tables, and a pager.
It is built on the shared
[zaxon-cli-ui](https://github.com/insanai/zaxon-cli-ui) module. Piped or
scripted invocations keep plain, byte-for-byte stable output.

Exit codes: `0` ok, `1` SQL/session error, `2` usage, `3` integrity
failure, `4` unavailable.

## The library

```zig
const zaxonlite = @import("zaxonlite");

var node = try zaxonlite.Node.open(gpa, io, .{ .directory = "./data" });
defer node.close();

_ = try node.exec("create table items(id integer primary key, v text)");

const session = try node.openSession();
_ = try node.execIdempotent(session, 1, "insert into items(v) values ('tea')");

var rows = try node.query(gpa, "select id, v from items order by id");
defer rows.deinit();
```

And from C:

```c
#include <zaxonlite.h>
zaxonlite *db;
zaxonlite_open("./data", &db);
int64_t changes;
zaxonlite_exec(db, "insert into items(v) values ('tea')", &changes);
zaxonlite_close(db);
```

## Benchmarks

The comparison harnesses live in [`benchmarks/`](benchmarks/), and every
recorded run, with environment metadata, is in
[`benchmarks/results/`](benchmarks/results/). The systems compared are
[rqlite](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite) (v10.2.7, installed binaries)
and [dqlite](https://github.com/canonical/dqlite) (harness present,
execution deferred, Linux-only). Both harnesses run three durable voters
per system with equal payloads, excluded warmup, verified results, and
percentile latency.

First, the boring benchmark: one client, sequential single-row writes, each
waiting for full durability. macOS arm64, three local voters, 256-byte rows.

| System            | Writes/s | p50 latency | p99 latency |
| ----------------- | -------: | ----------: | ----------: |
| zaxonlite         |     28.0 |     35.1 ms |     45.9 ms |
| rqlite v10.2.7    |     44.5 |     22.0 ms |     33.7 ms |

rqlite wins this one, and honesty requires printing it. Both systems are
paying for fsync on every write; the difference is bookkeeping around the
disk, not the disk itself. If a benchmark table only shows the rows its
author likes, you should not trust the other rows either.

Second, the benchmark that looks like a product: a deterministic
order-processing simulation. Four clients, idempotent writes, linearizable
reads, and a fixed crash schedule: kill a follower under traffic, kill the
leader under traffic, catch each up, then restart the whole three-node
cluster. Both systems must pass correctness checks at the end: inventory,
revenue, ledger, uniqueness, and per-node convergence.

| Measure                        | zaxonlite | rqlite v10.2.7 |
| ------------------------------ | --------: | -------------: |
| Healthy throughput             |  1,783/s  |        177/s   |
| Throughput, follower down      |  1,073/s  |        222/s   |
| Throughput, leader down        |    387/s  |         94/s   |
| Leader crash to first success  |    591 ms |       2,190 ms |
| Follower catch-up              |    112 ms |        949 ms  |
| Full cluster restart           |    446 ms |      1,626 ms  |

Why does the same system lose the first table and win the second? Because
the first table measures one client waiting on one disk, and the second
measures a cluster doing concurrent work and recovering from failures.
The workload shape decides the winner. Run the harnesses yourself before
believing anyone's table, including this one:

```sh
zig build benchmark                       # write/read/recovery microbenchmarks
zig build bench-cluster -- tls 2000 2000  # three-node transport benchmark
sh benchmarks/compare-rqlite-3node.sh     # needs installed rqlited/rqlite
```

## The security boundary, plainly

Production TCP requires mutual TLS 1.3. Peer certificate common names are
bound to configured node IDs, and TLS covers SQL, results, payloads, and
snapshots. An optional provider-file PSK adds sequenced HMAC protection
inside TLS. `--dev-psk` is for loopback experiments only; plaintext TCP is
gated behind test failpoints; local single-node service uses an owner-only
Unix socket. Static membership is the authorization boundary.

Files on disk (database, WAL, journal, snapshots, backups) are plaintext.
If you need protection from someone holding the disk, use full-disk or
filesystem encryption. We would rather tell you that than have you assume
otherwise.

## Current limits

One logical writer. One to nine statically configured voters, and no
automatic voter replacement yet. Transactions are capped at 64 MiB minus
framing. Windows needs release 1809 or Server 2019 and newer, on NTFS:
the storage layer relies on POSIX rename semantics and on the NTFS
metadata log to persist directory entries, and a node refuses to start
where a probe shows they are missing rather than quietly weakening the
guarantee. Unix socket listeners are POSIX-only; use loopback TCP on
Windows. Nothing on Windows is covered by a running test suite yet, only
by a cross-compile gate. The 10,000-crash stress gates and the 1 GiB
recovery target are deferred; the checked recovery fixture is 1 MiB.

## Build and test

Requires Zig 0.16 and system OpenSSL 3. SQLite 3.50.4 is a pinned
`build.zig.zon` dependency. The [paxos-zig](https://github.com/insanai/paxos-zig)
library is declared as a path dependency, so a checkout expects it beside
this one; released builds pin it by content hash with `zig fetch`.
Cross-builds pass `-Dopenssl-prefix` for the
target OpenSSL SDK.

```sh
zig build                    # zig-out/bin/zaxon and libzaxonlite.a
zig build check              # compile every binary without running
zig build test               # unit + shell + single-process integration
zig build test-crash         # spawned-process crash matrix
zig build test-cluster       # three-process scenario (-Dcluster-runs=N)
zig build test-roles         # voters, witness, standby, read replica
zig build test-gateway       # stateless end-to-end gateway
zig build test-fault-network # loss/duplication/reorder/fragmentation
zig build test-cli           # CLI contract
zig build test-cabi          # C ABI smoke test
zig build fuzz               # seeded property fuzzing
zig build soak               # sustained mixed load
```

API documentation: `zig build docs`, then `zig build docs-serve` and open
http://localhost:8000 (the autodoc output is a WASM application that
browsers refuse to load from `file://`).

## Data directory layout

```text

  LOCK                     # exclusive process lock
  identity                 # node/database IDs, current configuration
  paxos-<config>.log       # framed, checksummed protocol journal
  payloads/aa/<hash>       # immutable frame payloads by SHA-256
  snapshots/<config>/      # db image + manifest per sealed epoch
  CURRENT                  # installed snapshot pointer
  current.db               # materialized SQLite image (rebuildable)
```
